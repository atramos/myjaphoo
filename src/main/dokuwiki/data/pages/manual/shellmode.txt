====== Shell Mode ======

Starting with version 3.10 the application could also be used in batch mode and in shell mode.

This starts the application in interactive shell mode.
<code>
run.bat -i
</code>
The application will start a groovysh console and you can interact with the application by executing commands.

====== Shell Commands ======

===== Statistics =====
<code>
statistics
</code>
will print out some basic statistics about the current used database.

===== Import =====
<code>
imp <mode> <dir>
</code>
will start a media entry import from a given directory. 
Mode: Picture or Movie
dir: path to the directory where the media is



===== Batch Mode =====

You can also simply execute one command. This is helpful to e.g. write own batch scripts e.g. to import/update perodically. Therefore simply execute run.bat and append the command, e.g.:

<code>
run.bat imp Pictures c:\myDirWithPictures
</code>

will import/update the database with the media files in the given directory and the application stops after the import finished.

Example: import new files in a loop with a batch script:

<code>
:loop
call run.bat imp Pictures c:\myDirWithPictures
timeout /T 600 
goto loop
</code>
